Requirements to Run Your Python Code (Libraries, etc.)

1. Jupyter Notebook (Optional but recommended for interactive execution)
Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment for running and visualizing Python code. It allows you to run each code cell and see the results immediately.

2. To run the provided Python code, you need to install the following libraries:

PyTorch – For deep learning tasks, including neural network models, optimizers, and loss functions.
TorchVision – For pre-trained models and image transformations.
Scikit-Learn – For metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
Matplotlib – For visualizing data and results.
OpenCV – For image processing tasks.
NumPy – For numerical operations and data handling.

To install these dependencies, use the following pip commands:

# Install PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision

# Install scikit-learn 
pip install scikit-learn

# Install Matplotlib for plotting
pip install matplotlib

# Install OpenCV 
pip install opencv-python

# Install NumPy 
pip install numpy

3. Hardware Requirements:
GPU (Optional but highly recommended) – To accelerate model training, you can use a CUDA-enabled GPU. This can significantly speed up training times.
If a GPU is not available, PyTorch will automatically fall back to using the CPU.
